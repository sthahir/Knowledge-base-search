Local providers almost always have the best deals, and buying SIM cards is relatively inexpensive. \nEspecially in Asian countries (where I have more travel experience) you can easily pick up SIM cards at shopping kiosks almost anywhere, and the rates are really very cheap compared to where I live (New Zealand).\nData roaming from international providers is also very expensive; as an example with my New Zealand cellphone provider in China I would pay $US25+ a megabyte, whereas buying a local SIM card it cost me $US8 for 250 megabytes.\n", "question": {"subtitle": "I'm looking for data plans I can use while touring different countries within a region without having to worry about being eaten by roaming fees.
