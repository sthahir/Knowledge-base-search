Remember that nothing is ever guaranteed and it's quite possible with weather that you might not make it there.\nCruises:\nLarger cruises often will get you close but not to the land. You'll have the comforts of cruising. These big ships may be regulated soon. Smaller ships will often let you get right onto land. Costs start at least $5k (for the ultra cheap).\nTailored Expeditions:\nMany companies run specialty expeditions which let you visit Antarctica exactly how you want. Prices are extremely high for this.\nAirborne:\nYou get to fly over Antarctica. This is the more ecological way to see it but doesn't have the same experience as actually walking on it. This is also the cheapest option.\n", "question": {"subtitle": "A year ago I was reading some magazine, and found out that there is availability to get a trip to Antarctica.\nUnfortunately, there was no info about how I could get there.\nDo you know anything about it?
