I know only a few words and am travelling on my own.  Fair warning - Russia (my second visit) is the hardest country I've travelled in.  I struggle with the Cyrillic - but it's definitely worth learning.  It gets faster to read quite quickly.\nOne of the best suggestions is to write requests down.  For example - trains, I write the destination (in Cyrillic), the time (numbers are mostly universal) and the class, and draw a set of bunks to indicate the top bunk.  Almost no words are required, but it's clear what I'm after.\nIt's hard, but I arrived with fewer than 10 words, and I've certainly managed - entering from Finland, I went to Murmansk, down to St Petersburg, across to Moscow and back, and now down to Volgograd.  It's a fantastic country, well worth it, but it IS hard :)\n", "question": {"subtitle": "Or alternatively - how well-spoken (and widely-spoken) is English? \nI intend to visit St. Petersburg, Moscow, Irkutsk and Vladivostok.\nI feel like I might have the most troubles in the latter two cities. \nShould I be able to read the Cyrillic alphabet?\n", "title": "How much Russian do I need to know for travelling within Russia?"}, "user_metadata": {"username": "Mark Mayo", "reputation": 120821, "id": "101"}, "answer_metadata": {"accepted": 0, "length": 845, "score": 16, "upModVotes": 16, "downModVotes": 0, "id": "174"}, "id": "8bbc8dc9e447bbf6630a15c2c955b7fb"}
