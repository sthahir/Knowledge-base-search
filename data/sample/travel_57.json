If you're imagining yourself and a guide whacking your way though the jungle I think you're going to be disappointed. There are many developments on both sides of the river and lots of boat traffic. Most tourists stay at a \"jungle lodge\" which is typically just a simple hotel set on the riverbank. Activities include piranha fishing, looking for alligators at night and perhaps a short trek into the jungle.\nThere may be some guides that can take you further into the \"deep\" jungle, but this is not what most tourists do. I've heard that the Amazon jungle in Peru may be more rewarding for wildlife and perhaps more remote, but I have no personal experience.\n", "question": {"subtitle": "This was one of our definition questions, but also one that interests me personally: How can I find a guide that will take me safely through the Amazon jungle? I'd love to explore the Amazon but would not attempt it without a guide, at least not the first time. And I'd prefer a guide that wasn't going to ambush me or anything :P\nEdit: I don't want to go anywhere \"touristy\".  Start and end points are open, but the trip should take me places where I am not likely to see other travellers / tourists and where I will definitely require a good guide in order to be safe.\n", "title": "How can I find a guide that will take me safely through the Amazon jungle?"}, "user_metadata": {"username": "user27478", "reputation": 4395, "id": "11"}, "answer_metadata": {"accepted": 0, "length": 713, "score": 6, "upModVotes": 8, "downModVotes": 2, "id": "57"}, "id": "909b56865b21f721c9a491ac0aedc61e"}
