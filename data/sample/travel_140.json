However, on the last day of the summit the temperature can get well below freezing, so you should have an insulated bottle for this part. If you carry a camelback, the water in the tube will also freeze if it's not insulated.\n", "question": {"subtitle": "I am attempting a summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro (Africa) later in the year. I have most of my gear, however the one thing I am unsure of is the best way to hydrate and store/carry my water.  I am also unsure of purification methods.\nI know I am supposed to drink 3 - 5L a day when hiking and my initial thought was to take a 3L camelback and two 1L bottles.  Is this too much?\nI am also worried about the water freezing at the higher altitudes, what measures can I take to prevent this?.  What are experiences other have had Kilimanjaro or not?\n", "title": "What is a good hydration system for hiking Kilimanjaro?"}, "user_metadata": {"username": "Seanland", "reputation": 1191, "id": "8"}, "answer_metadata": {"accepted": 1, "length": 777, "score": 9, "upModVotes": 9, "downModVotes": 0, "id": "140"}, "id": "ebbe2f9cb761634e09cdda0b169821b6"}
