My answer would be that it depends on the type of trip you are planning. If you have inflexible dates or a set itinerary I'd recommend getting the tickets as soon as you know these details. Also, if your itinerary involves low-traffic routes or minor destinations with infrequent flights I'd tend to buy early rather than waiting. While you can sometimes get better prices by waiting (even to the last minute) the number of itineraries at sale prices is usually limited and may not be exactly what you wanted.\nIf you have flexible dates, the trip is \"optional\", or you are flying a popular route you could try waiting on the chance to catch a sale. Keep in mind that the later you buy your ticket the later you are making other reservations such as for hotels or rental cars which could have gone up in price. Finally, bing Travel has a feature that analyzes airfare trends and predicts whether you should buy now or wait for a better price, but it only works on high-traffic USA domestic route.\n", "question": {"subtitle": "My boyfriend and I are looking to visit Shanghai and Hong Kong in December, and we were wondering when the best (the cheapest price) time to buy tickets would be.
