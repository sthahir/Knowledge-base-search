I do enjoy guided tours on some occassions, but I'm more interested in finding cool local markets/restaurants/historical sites, photography opportunities, or nearby nature walks/hikes that are hidden gems.\nFor example, when in Sydney, a relative pointed us to a small nature reserve (one of hundreds or thousands when simply looking at a map) that turned out to be a deep, beautiful forest in the middle of a neighborhood.\nBefore a trip, I usually search online for reviews of \"things to do\" but mostly I just come up with tourist traps.  So how do I find the opposite of tourist traps once I'm actually on site?\n", "title": "What are some good ways to find things to explore on-site in an unfamiliar place?"}, "user_metadata": {"username": "Seanland", "reputation": 1191, "id": "8"}, "answer_metadata": {"accepted": 0, "length": 255, "score": 13, "upModVotes": 13, "downModVotes": 0, "id": "52"}, "id": "a96527c629234f5d3f9e462e6cc736ce"}
