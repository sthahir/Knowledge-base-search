That would be able to give you an idea.

I do enjoy guided tours on some occassions, but I'm more interested in finding cool local markets/restaurants/historical sites, photography opportunities, or nearby nature walks/hikes that are hidden gems.\nFor example, when in Sydney, a relative pointed us to a small nature reserve (one of hundreds or thousands when simply looking at a map) that turned out to be a deep, beautiful forest in the middle of a neighborhood.\nBefore a trip, I usually search online for reviews of \"things to do\" but mostly I just come up with tourist traps.  So how do I find the opposite of tourist traps once I'm actually on site?\n", "title": "What are some good ways to find things to explore on-site in an unfamiliar place?"}, "user_metadata": {"username": "Francesca Venturini", "reputation": 140, "id": "56"}, "answer_metadata": {"accepted": 0, "length": 513, "score": 1, "upModVotes": 2, "downModVotes": 1, "id": "94"}, "id": "9229efd121286ac78d5db6c870bb5cc4"}
