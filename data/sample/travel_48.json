Usually they have some concierge services that work only during the day and try to give you the standard advices.\nI also got some very good deals asking taxi drivers but the better ones were from bus drivers!\nSo, the advice is: ask someone local.

I do enjoy guided tours on some occassions, but I'm more interested in finding cool local markets/restaurants/historical sites, photography opportunities, or nearby nature walks/hikes that are hidden gems.\nFor example, when in Sydney, a relative pointed us to a small nature reserve (one of hundreds or thousands when simply looking at a map) that turned out to be a deep, beautiful forest in the middle of a neighborhood.\nBefore a trip, I usually search online for reviews of \"things to do\" but mostly I just come up with tourist traps.  So how do I find the opposite of tourist traps once I'm actually on site?\n", "title": "What are some good ways to find things to explore on-site in an unfamiliar place?"}, "user_metadata": {"username": "Rodolfo", "reputation": 1142, "id": "40"}, "answer_metadata": {"accepted": 1, "length": 455, "score": 22, "upModVotes": 22, "downModVotes": 0, "id": "48"}, "id": "fc42a3a9d48d0061e63db52e8aa5d2c6"}
