The only advantage of a private car service is that the cost is fixed unlike a taxi where the price on the meter (if there is one) can vary depending on the route, how long it takes or how much the driver feels like charging. There is also the possibility of getting ripped off by a taxi driver. Also, the private car services tend to have newer cars and in my experience the drivers can be a little less \"crazy\". Finally, I've found that in some cities that the only taxis that are possible to call by phone are private taxis and that regular taxis can only be hailed on the street.\n", "question": {"subtitle": "When planning a trip I've seen people say private cars are scams and other people say they can be better than city taxi's because you know how much it will cost ahead of time. Are there any other advantages that a private car may have over a city taxi? Are there any other disadvantages other than the cost? Do city taxis have hidden costs that a traveler should be aware of (such as \"running the meter\" while waiting for a rider)?\n", "title": "Are there advantages to using private car service over taxis from the airport?"}, "user_metadata": {"username": "user27478", "reputation": 4395, "id": "11"}, "answer_metadata": {"accepted": 0, "length": 639, "score": 4, "upModVotes": 5, "downModVotes": 1, "id": "61"}, "id": "37ef10ff8ff7d23e8b30e595a293a3fe"}
