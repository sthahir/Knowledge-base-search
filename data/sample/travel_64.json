You may find some very different options depending on the city you plan to start.

Both are big cities and you will find good places to stay there.\n", "question": {"subtitle": "This was one of our definition questions, but also one that interests me personally: How can I find a guide that will take me safely through the Amazon jungle?

And I'd prefer a guide that wasn't going to ambush me or anything :P\nEdit: I don't want to go anywhere \"touristy\".  Start and end points are open, but the trip should take me places where I am not likely to see other travellers / tourists and where I will definitely require a good guide in order to be safe.\n", "title": "How can I find a guide that will take me safely through the Amazon jungle?"}, "user_metadata": {"username": "Rodolfo", "reputation": 1142, "id": "40"}, "answer_metadata": {"accepted": 0, "length": 344, "score": 15, "upModVotes": 15, "downModVotes": 0, "id": "64"}, "id": "d99b74ea65e8179225a0c61ab967c042"}
