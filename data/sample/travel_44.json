I do enjoy guided tours on some occassions, but I'm more interested in finding cool local markets/restaurants/historical sites, photography opportunities, or nearby nature walks/hikes that are hidden gems.\nFor example, when in Sydney, a relative pointed us to a small nature reserve (one of hundreds or thousands when simply looking at a map) that turned out to be a deep, beautiful forest in the middle of a neighborhood.\nBefore a trip, I usually search online for reviews of \"things to do\" but mostly I just come up with tourist traps.  So how do I find the opposite of tourist traps once I'm actually on site?\n", "title": "What are some good ways to find things to explore on-site in an unfamiliar place?"}, "user_metadata": {"username": "Michael Teper", "reputation": 768, "id": "23"}, "answer_metadata": {"accepted": 0, "length": 399, "score": 5, "upModVotes": 5, "downModVotes": 0, "id": "44"}, "id": "c4b91345b890ec15771b0ef9ef5fd771"}
