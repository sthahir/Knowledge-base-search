Being a wiki, quite often people will enter info about strikes - I found the road between Uyuni and La Paz was closed two weeks before and two weeks after I went through, and I got that via Wikitravel.  \nNote that from Cusco, you will most likely travel to Puno first.  It's a small, mostly dull town, but from there you have two travel options.  The quick bus route south to La Paz (see link) or you can go via Copacobana, where you and the bus take separate ferrie across.  If you have time, that route sounds quite interesting and fun.  \nThe point, however, is that there are two routes, so even if one gets blocked, there's a chance you'll have another way :)  If in doubt, follow the locals, they'll be used to it!\n", "question": {"subtitle": "I need to travel from Cusco, Peru to La Paz, Bolivia next month but people in both countries have a habit of blocking roads quite frequently.\nEvery now and then I see news articles in the regular media about certain strikes still going strong (like right now between Cusco and La Paz...) but I was wondering if there is something like a web site somewhere that has up-to-date information about whole regions / countries / continents.\n", "title": "Where can I find up-to-date information about roadblocks and strikes in Peru and Bolivia?"}, "user_metadata": {"username": "Mark Mayo", "reputation": 120821, "id": "101"}, "answer_metadata": {"accepted": 0, "length": 740, "score": 6, "upModVotes": 6, "downModVotes": 0, "id": "175"}, "id": "f9a55ba3e868599f91a6fdc4151a4f14"}
