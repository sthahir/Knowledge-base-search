(Clear and calm, strong swell, covered with seaweed, etc.)\nIs the water good for swimming? (Counter-example: we took a trip to Broome, Western Australia and found out that basically one shouldn't swim at all during the time of year we were there due to jellyfish/stinger threats)\n\nAnd once I know what questions to ask about the destination, what is the best method of finding a good match?\n", "title": "What kind of questions should I be asking about tropical destinations?"}, "user_metadata": {"username": "jeroen", "reputation": 306, "id": "22"}, "answer_metadata": {"accepted": 0, "length": 104, "score": 11, "upModVotes": 11, "downModVotes": 0, "id": "101"}, "id": "dfe3f734d414386e7b3163cba87a14e5"}
