I've only used a private car service once, in Lima, Peru, as the taxi drivers are notorious for ripoffs and theft. When I arrived at the hostel I was staying at, there were two people staying there who had all of their belongings stolen by their taxi driver at knifepoint. An Australian tourist was also recently shot by her taxi driver in Lima after refusing to hand over her belongings. \nIn retrospect it seems like that was $20USD well spent, but I wouldn't bother paying it in places that didn't have a reputation.\n", "question": {"subtitle": "When planning a trip I've seen people say private cars are scams and other people say they can be better than city taxi's because you know how much it will cost ahead of time. Are there any other advantages that a private car may have over a city taxi? Are there any other disadvantages other than the cost? Do city taxis have hidden costs that a traveler should be aware of (such as \"running the meter\" while waiting for a rider)?\n", "title": "Are there advantages to using private car service over taxis from the airport?"}, "user_metadata": {"username": "jozzas", "reputation": 2219, "id": "65"}, "answer_metadata": {"accepted": 0, "length": 570, "score": 6, "upModVotes": 7, "downModVotes": 1, "id": "107"}, "id": "bdcd6a9cc1438a3faa8c925f6a8d9429"}
