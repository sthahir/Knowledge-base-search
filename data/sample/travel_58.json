So I do not recommend you to try \"winter stuff\". Buenos Aires is Argentina's capital. You must go to a Tango show (some requires you to book in advance). You also must eat a typical barbecue (if you are not vegetarian). I love everything they do with milk and also their wines are very good (Malbec is the better grape). They have been considered as \"small Europe in South America\", and you should visit places like Caminito in Buenos Aires. \nYou should also visit Patagonia, maybe with a small boat trip to explore the views. \nYou can also try the Andine Lakes, between Argentina and Chile. In this case, I recommend you to start in one country and return home by the other. \n", "question": {"subtitle": "We are considering visiting Argentina for up to ten days during mid-to-late December.
