(Clear and calm, strong swell, covered with seaweed, etc.)\nIs the water good for swimming? (Counter-example: we took a trip to Broome, Western Australia and found out that basically one shouldn't swim at all during the time of year we were there due to jellyfish/stinger threats)\n\nAnd once I know what questions to ask about the destination, what is the best method of finding a good match?\n", "title": "What kind of questions should I be asking about tropical destinations?"}, "user_metadata": {"username": "silent1mezzo", "reputation": 1938, "id": "9"}, "answer_metadata": {"accepted": 0, "length": 448, "score": 5, "upModVotes": 6, "downModVotes": 1, "id": "39"}, "id": "0446d1f8fea38964c486c7c758760d47"}
